N integers are passed as input. The program must print only the integers that are present in the Fibonacci series.

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
Integers that are part of the Fibonacci series in their order of occurrence (separated by a space).

Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 9999999

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
13 2 10 4 8

Output:
13 2 8

Explanation:
The Fibonacci series is 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 and so on. So the input values that are part of the Fibonacci series are 13 2 8 in their order of occurrence.

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=s.nextInt();
     for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
     {
         Long val=s.nextLong();
         Long v1=5*val*val+4;
         Long v2=5*val*val-4;
         Long num1=(long)(Math.sqrt(v1));
         Long num2=(long)(Math.sqrt(v2));

         if(num1*num1 == v1 || num2*num2 == v2)
         System.out.println(val);
     }
	}
}

A string S is passed as the input. A positive integer X is also passed as the input. The program must print the characters at positions which are multiples of X.
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains X.

Output Format:
The first line contains the characters at positions which are multiples of X.

Boundary Conditions:
Length of S will be from 3 to 100.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcdexyzwqpoolj
5

Output:
eqj

Explanation:
The multiples of 5 are like 5, 10, 15,...
So the characters in these positions are e,q,j

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
		String str=s.nextLine();
		int x=s.nextInt();
		
		for(int i=x;i<=str.length();i=i+x)
		System.out.print(str.charAt(i-1));

	}
}
